I do research that drives more sustainable and ethical aquaculture, 
as well as a better understanding of how aquaculture activities 
interact with the coastal marine environment. 
The dream is the development of aquaculture industries that have 
negligible or positive effects on the local environment. 
I use a range of approaches, including field and lab experiments, 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and more recently, 
analysis of large public databases.
