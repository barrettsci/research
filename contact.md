I'm currently a Research Fellow in Innovative Aquaculture, based within the [SALTT](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/saltt) lab at the University of Melbourne (Australia) and the [Animal Welfare](https://www.hi.no/en/hi/forskning/research-groups-1/animal-welfare) research group at the Institute of Marine Research (Norway). I'm also contracting with [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/how-investors-can-turn-the-tide-on-aquaculture/) to produce some research on the potential value of sustainably developed bivalve and seaweed aquaculture globally.  

I like collaborating and sharing research, so feel free to get in touch by [email](luke.barrett@unimelb.edu.au) or follow me to see what I've been up to:

In my spare time, I can be found in the ocean hunting for a feed, or else up a mountain with a [camera](https://lukebarrett.com).
