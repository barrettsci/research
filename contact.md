I'm based in Tim Dempster's [**SALTT**](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/saltt) lab in the School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne, Australia, and am also contracting with [**The Nature Conservancy**](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/how-investors-can-turn-the-tide-on-aquaculture/) on their global sustainable aquaculture project.
