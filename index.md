I do research that drives more sustainable and ethical aquaculture and a better understanding of how aquaculture affects wildlife. I also have an interest in temperate reef ecology, especially in maintaining productive and diverse temperate reef ecosystems in areas impacted by human activities.

## Current research topics
    
#### **Effects of aquaculture on wildlife**
Aquaculture modifies coastal marine environments by providing structure and nutrients. A better understanding of effects on wildlife can be used to achieve more positive outcomes.

#### **Avoiding sea lice in Atlantic salmon aquaculture**
Salmon farms amplify louse densities, causing welfare issues and production losses for farmed salmon and threatening wild salmonid populations. New methods are needed to prevent, monitor and treat infestations.

#### **Ecology of seaweed and temperate reef habitats**
Seaweed reef habitats are under threat from multiple stressors, including eutrophication, sedimentation and overgrazing. I'm interested in the role and conservation of seaweed habitats in degraded coastal areas.
