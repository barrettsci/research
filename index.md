title: Overview

I do research to drive more sustainable use of the coastal marine environment. I'm interested in animal welfare within sea cage fish farming, effects of aquaculture on the coastal environment (including wildlife), and how to maintain productive and diverse temperate reef ecosystems in areas impacted by human activities.

## Current research topics
    
### **Effects of aquaculture on wildlife**
Aquaculture modifies coastal marine environments by providing structure and nutrients. A better understanding of effects on wildlife can be used to achieve more positive outcomes.  

**Partners**: Institute of Marine Research (Norway), The Nature Conservancy (USA)

### **Managing sea lice in salmon aquaculture**
Salmon farms amplify louse densities, causing welfare issues and production losses for farmed salmon and threatening wild salmonid populations. New methods are needed to prevent, monitor and treat infestations.

### **Ecology of seaweed and temperate reef habitats**
Seaweed reef habitats are under threat from multiple stressors, including eutrophication, sedimentation and overgrazing. I'm interested in the role and conservation of seaweed habitats in degraded coastal areas.
