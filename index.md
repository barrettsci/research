title: Overview
---

I do research that drives more sustainable and ethical aquaculture, as well as a better understanding of how aquaculture activities 
interact with the coastal marine environment. The dream is the development of aquaculture industries that have negligible or positive effects on the local environment. I use a range of approaches, including field and lab experiments, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and more recently, analysis of large public databases.

# Current projects

### **Interactions between aquaculture sites and wildlife**
Aquaculture modifies coastal marine environments by providing structural complexity and export of nutrients to the environment. A better understanding of effects on wildlife can be used to minimise negative impacts and maximise beneficial effects. I'm currently working with The Nature Conservancy to better understand the role of seaweed and shellfish farms as habitat for marine animals.

### **Lice infestations in Atlantic salmon aquaculture**
Salmon farms amplify lice densities, causing welfare issues and production losses for farmed salmon, and survival challenges for wild salmonid populations. New methods are needed to prevent, monitor and treat infestations. Most of this work is done in collaboration with researchers at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, with funding from FHF and MSD Animal Health Norge.
