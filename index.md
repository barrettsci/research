title: Overview

I do research to drive more sustainable use of the coastal marine environment. I'm especially interested in the effects of aquaculture on wildlife populations, how to improve animal welfare in fish farming, and how to maintain productive and diverse temperate reef ecosystems in areas impacted by human activities.

## Current research topics
    
### **Effects of aquaculture on wildlife populations**
Aquaculture modifies coastal marine environments by providing structure and nutrients. This has wide-ranging effects on local wildlife, including habitat provision for some species and displacement of others. A better understanding of these effects can help achieve more positive outcomes for wildlife populations, mitigate negative impacts, and maximise provision of ecosystem services for humans.

### **Managing sea lice in salmon aquaculture**
Intensive salmon farming has brought great economic benefits for several countries, but also problems. Salmon farms amplify parasitic sea lice densities, causing welfare issues and production losses for farmed salmon and threatening wild salmonid populations that swim too close to heavily infested farms. New methods are needed to prevent, monitor and treat infestations.

### **Ecology of temperate reef habitats**
Seaweed and kelp habitats are diverse and productive, but have come under threat from multiple stressors including eutrophication, sedimentation and overgrazing. I'm interested in the conservation of seaweed habitats in degraded coastal areas.
